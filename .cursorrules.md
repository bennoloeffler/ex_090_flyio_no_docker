- have a look at doc/design.md, where the principle idea of the application is explained - NEVER UPDATE THAT ON YOUR OWN. IF YOU INTEND: ASK ME BEFORE.
- There are TODOS.md. Always work on the TOP entry of TODOS.MD. If the user asks for something else, give him a hint - and then deviate from TODOs.md. But alsways come back until all the tests are written, the API makes sense
- As soon as the current TOP TODO is done - that means: 
  - tests are written
  - factored out in owen files < 300 lines
  - API of the functionality is reviewed and understandable
  - all functions are commented
  - pydantic is used in all signatures to document typing
  - functions are AS FAR AS POSSIBLE pure - so parameters and reaturn values are used instead of reading or writing some other state
  THEN AND ONLY THEN: Mark it done [x].
- make small, pure functions, whenever possible to make testing easy
- use pytest to write tests
- use uv and NOT PIP to manage the project and project dependencies
  - check if "uv venv" AND "source .venv/bin/activate" have been used to create a py .venv. IF NOT: Complain!
  - ryproject.toml file is used to manage dependencies
  - uv run ...
  - uv add <package>
  - uv sync
  - ...
- if asked to initialize the project,
  - check - and if missing - create a doc folder and in there the files DESIGN.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, TODOS.md: ASK ME FOR THE BASIC IDEAS to fill in a first draft
  - create a best practice python project with pyproject.toml and modules, test folder,
  - check - and if missing - create tests folder and an test_sample_py
  - check - and if missing - create a .cursorrules.md
  - install pytest with `uv add pytest`
  - check - and if missing - create a pytest.ini
  - check - and if missing - create a shell script run_and_watch_tests.sh to watch test continously. Content, just two lines: #!/bin/bash\nptw\n
  - check - and if missing - create a README.md and UPDATE it with everything important about the project (purpose, running, deploying, developement, ..., )
  - check if ptw is running
  - prepare deployment to fly.io WITHOUT Docker: that works with fly launch --no-docker (maybe 'fly auth login' before)

  ASK BEFORE OVERWRITING SOMETHING.
